# Welcome to GoHangman!
This is another small, text based game that emulates the game hangman. The drawing of the person has not yet been implemented, but the game is fully function, using a number of guesses rather than drawing the person.

## Usage
You can run the program by simply typing `Hangman.exe`. There are also difficulty flags, which can be accessed using `Hangman.exe -d=[easy, medium, hard]`. 

The hard difficulty gives only 3 guesses, the medium 5 (default), and the easy 7.

Have fun!
